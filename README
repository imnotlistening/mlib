1.  Intro

    This project is still a work in progress. As I have time I will keep
updating it further and further.

2.  Building

2.0  Building from a distribution

     Although there are no releases yet, eventually the code will be buildable
by the familiar:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    # make install

2.1  Building from git source

    If you are building from the git sources, then you will need to build the
autoconf scripts. Since MLib needs shared libraries, the process involves
libtool:

    $ cd mlib.git/
    $ libtoolize
    $ autoreconf --install
    $ ./configure # etc, etc
